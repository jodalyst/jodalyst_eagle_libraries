### PDQ15-D (pdq-15d.lbr) ###

This is a nifty all-in-one series voltage converters.  I'm particularly fond of the PDQ15-Q24-D15-D but that's just me being me:

### PA340 High Voltage Op Amp (PA340CC.lbr) ###

This bad boy/girl/gender-neutral part is a really cool high voltage op amp by Apex Semiconductors in a DDPAK-7 footprint, which annoyingly does not have a standard generic equivalent that I can find in the EAGLE libraries so this might be a good starting point for others building using a DDPAK part (I'm seeing lots of high voltage op amps out there using this package).
